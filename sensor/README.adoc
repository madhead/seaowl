= seaowl sensor

== How to use

First, install https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c[this library] as described in their docs.

Build seaowl:

	./gradlew compileKonan

Run it:

    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib build/konan/bin/linux/seaowl.kexe /dev/co2mini0

That's it.
Here, `/dev/co2mini0` is the CO2 mini device as seen by your OS.
Actually, it's a symlink for `/dev/hidrawX` created by this simple udev rule:

    ACTION=="remove", GOTO="co2mini_end"

    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", KERNEL=="hidraw*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="04d9", ATTRS{idProduct}=="a052", MODE="0666", SYMLINK+="co2mini%n", GOTO="co2mini_end"

    LABEL="co2mini_end"

Mode is set to `666` to simplify your life, actually it's better to assign a user / group to the device.
